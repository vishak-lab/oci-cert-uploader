A simple script to **import or update SSL certificates** into **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Certificate Management Service**.

This works with certificates from **any provider** â€“ Letâ€™s Encrypt, Sectigo, DigiCert, etc.

## ðŸ”§ What This Script Does

- Reads a certificate (`fullchain.pem`) and private key (`privkey.pem`) from your local file system.
- Checks if a certificate for the given domain already exists in OCI:

  - ðŸ†• If not â†’ creates a new certificate entry.
- Can be scheduled to run every 30 days using `cron` or any automation tool.

- Valid certificate and private key files on disk.
